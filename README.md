## Topic Proposals

with us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/dsmjs/talk-proposals/issues)
to our [talk-proposals repo](https://github.com/dsmjs/talk-proposals).

Topics can be either something you'd like to share your knowledge about or something
you'd like to learn about from someone else.

If you'd like to give a talk, but don't have a topic in mind, browse the
[topic requests](https://github.com/dsmjs/talk-proposals/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22topic+request%22)
